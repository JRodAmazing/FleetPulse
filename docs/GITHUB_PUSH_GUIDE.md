# ðŸš€ How to Push to GitHub - Right Now!

## Quick Version (Copy & Paste in PowerShell)

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd C:\Users\jcrod\Desktop\FleetPulse

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "Day 2: Service logs + PDF reports working - Production ready"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main

# Verify
git log --oneline -5
```

## What This Does

1. **`git add .`** - Stages all your changes (frontend, backend, docs)
2. **`git commit -m "..."`** - Creates a commit snapshot with description
3. **`git push origin main`** - Uploads to GitHub
4. **`git log`** - Shows your commits (verify it worked)
