## 🔍 What Was Fixed Today (PDF Issue)

### Problem
```
DocumentComposeException: multiple child elements to a single-child container
```

### Root Causes
1. Wrong property names in PDF service (looking for properties that don't exist)
2. Incorrect QuestPDF container nesting (Padding can't have multiple children)
3. Deprecated API usage (RelativeColumn instead of RelativeItem)

### Solution
Complete rewrite of `PdfReportService.cs` with:
- ✅ Correct property mapping (`DatePerformed`, `LaborCost`, `HoursAtService`)
- ✅ Proper container hierarchy (Column with multiple Items)
- ✅ Updated QuestPDF API (RelativeColumn/RelativeItem properly used)
- ✅ Professional table formatting
- ✅ Error logging for debugging

### Result
✅ PDF generation working perfectly!
