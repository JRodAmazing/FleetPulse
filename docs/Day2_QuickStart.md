## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Build
```
Error: The type or namespace name 'SimplePdfService' could not be found
```
**Solution:** We created the service for you in `/Services/SimplePdfService.cs`
- Run: `dotnet clean && dotnet build`

### Frontend Shows "Failed to connect to backend"
- Check backend is running: `dotnet run` in backend folder
- Check port: `http://localhost:5038/swagger`
- Check `.env.local` has: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5038`

### PDF Downloads as BIN or Empty
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito/private window
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend returns 200 status

### Form Won't Submit
- Check all required fields are filled (marked with *)
- Open browser console (F12) and look for errors
- Check network tab to see API response

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I add custom shop branding?**
A: Yes! Edit `PdfReportService.cs` and update these constants:
```csharp
private const string ShopName = "Your Shop Name";
private const string ShopAddress = "Your Address";
private const string ShopPhone = "(555) 123-4567";
```

**Q: How do I change the database?**
A: Currently using in-memory storage. To add SQLite:
- Add `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite` NuGet package
- Create DbContext class
- Add to Program.cs: `services.AddDbContext<FleetPulseDbContext>();`

**Q: Can I deploy this?**
A: Yes! Day 3 will cover deployment to:
- Frontend: Vercel (free)
