# Day 2 Status Report - Build Fix & Implementation Complete

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for Testing  
**Time Spent:** ~2 hours (Debugging + Creating missing service + Frontend detail page)

---

## üîß Problem Fixed

### Original Error
```
FleetPulse.API failed with 1 error(s) (0.7s)
    C:\Users\jcrod\Desktop\FleetPulse\backend\FleetPulse.API\Controllers\ReportsController.cs(33,40): 
    error CS0246: The type or namespace name 'SimplePdfService' could not be found
```

### Root Cause
- `ReportsController.cs` was calling `new SimplePdfService()` on line 33
- The service class didn't exist
- Dependency injection for the service wasn't configured

### Solution Implemented
1. ‚úÖ Created `Services/SimplePdfService.cs` with lightweight PDF generation
2. ‚úÖ Updated `Program.cs` to register the service in DI container
3. ‚úÖ Now provides two PDF endpoints:
   - Simple/test PDF (fallback)
   - Full professional PDF with QuestPDF

---

## ‚ú® New Features Implemented

### Backend Services (Done ‚úÖ)

**SimplePdfService** (`Services/SimplePdfService.cs`)
- Generates minimal valid PDF files

**Endpoints** (Already in ReportsController)
```
GET /api/reports/{equipmentId}/generate          (Full report)
GET /api/reports/{equipmentId}/generate-simple   (Simple report)
```

**Service Log CRUD** (Already in EquipmentController)
```
GET    /api/equipment/{id}/logs      (Get all logs)
POST   /api/equipment/{id}/logs      (Add new log)
```

### Frontend UI (NEW - Ready ‚úÖ)

**Equipment Detail Page** (`app/equipment/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Equipment info cards (Status, Hours, Records)
- Service history table with sorting
- "New Service Log" modal form with validation:
  - Date picker
  - Hours input
  - Notes textarea
  - Labor cost input
